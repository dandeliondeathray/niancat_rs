Niancat
=======
Niancat is a Slack bot used by me and my friends to assist in a word puzzle we have every day. The
puzzle consists of nine shuffled letters, that correspond to a word.

The niancat bot assists us by checking if a given word (provided in a private message) is in a
dictionary of Swedish words. If that is the case, then it notifies the general channel that a
solution has been found.
